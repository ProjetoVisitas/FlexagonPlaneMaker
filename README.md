# FlexagonPlaneMaker
Flexagons are Origami-like planes in which we can hide images and make them appear by making a certain sequence of folds. In this repository we explore the plane creation by submitting of images you want to do the trick with. This game-like activity has proved to be quite useful when working with kids, said based on the Project's experience.
